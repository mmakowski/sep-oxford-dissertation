\title{A Neural Model for Software Vulnerability Prediction}
\subtitle{Project Proposal} 
\author{Maciek Makowski}

\end{abstract}

\section{Area of Study}

* software vulnerabilities are widespread and affect millions of people, massive cost for economy (WannaCry etc.)
* ways to address: code reviews, pen testing (require human intervention), formal methods, fuzzing\cite{neville2016towards}
* metadata mining\cite{shin2011evaluating}
* machine learning promises to replace humans\cite{scandariato2014predicting}
* language modelling techniques could be used\cite{karpathy2015unreasonable}
* representation learning: eliminates feature engineering, but requires lots of training data;
to what extent can it be applied?
* threats to validity: where to find negative examples?

\section{Proposed Work}

\subsection{Scope}

* data sets + augmentation
* choice of input representation
* choice of the model (RNN/attention) -- focus on both quality and interpretability
* implementation of the model
* interpretability

\subsection{Techniques}

* unsupervised learning to improve accuracy (too little training data for the model to
  work without that); Karpathy used ca. 500MB of C code
* interpretability: visualisation of the relevant features

\subsection{Outcomes}

* quality: probably not state of the art
* source code features that are predictors of 

\section{Project Plan}

* data collection
* model implementation and experiments
